How to 
-------
To produce a trade flow map in R , we could use the arrows drawing tool:
```{r fig.width=11}
x <- stats::runif(12); y <- stats::rnorm(12)
i <- order(x, y); x <- x[i]; y <- y[i]
plot(x,y, main = "arrows(.) and segments(.)")
## draw arrows from point to point :
s <- seq(length(x)-1)  # one shorter than data
arrows(x[s], y[s], x[s+1], y[s+1], col = 1:3, lwd=c(1,6,18))
s <- s[-length(s)]
segments(x[s], y[s], x[s+2], y[s+2], col = "pink")
```

To represent trade flow from country A to country B. 
We want to avoid over plotting arround the center of a country.
From the coordinates of a country, we can calculated the center of a country.
We would need to draw a circle or a square arround the center of each country and have the arrows going from the outside of circle A to the outside of circle B.
